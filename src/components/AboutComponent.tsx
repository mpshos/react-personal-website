                    <p>My name is Mike Shostrand. I'm a software engineer currently looking for a challenging opportunity in the Denver area! I have spent most of my professional at Garmin working on an embedded system as a UI developer. I dive into that in depth in the <a href="#experience">Experience</a> Section</p>

                    <p>Lately, I have become more fascinated with web technologies. I've been doing some React development and am taking more classes related to these topics. I hope to find a place where to work when I can quickly expand my knowledge of scaling techniques and web technologies and make a difference quickly.</p>
